            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Towards the latter end of <hi>July</hi> laſt, when the King lay at <hi>Woburne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Louderdale</hi> came one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about foure five of the Clock to the Court, loſt no time, but preſently made a repaire to His Majeſty with whom hee had much private communication. It was commonly reported and generally beleived that he had come poſt all the night before. But whether ſo or not, I know not, but this I know, that his early comming and haſty ſpeaking with His Majeſty at that Conjuncture of time, when that unparalled vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence was committed upon the Parliament, and that treaſonable engagement for fetching the King to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and preparations for a new Warre, were ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently proſecuted in the City, drove the Court into feares, and Souldiers into jealouſies, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip came to indeavour the perfecting at Court that deſigne, which was begun and proſecuted in the City and that which made them (as I conceive the more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his intentions, was a common report, that his Lordſhip was a fomenter of the Cities Tumults, or correſponding with the Authours of them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I finde, that the Souldiers had long entertained harſh toughts of the Lord <hi>louderdale</hi> ever ſince his Relation, concerning His Majeſties going from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denby,</hi> made in the Painted Chamber ſo much to the prejudice and diſadvantage of the Army; and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking there to ingage the whole Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as one man againſt the Army; they were playn with him at <hi>New-Market,</hi> then minding him of it, and told him he had publikely declared himſelfe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; therefore they could not but think he came to doe them, and the Kingdome ill Offices.</p>
            <p>And had not my ſelfe and other Officers interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160535:3"/>they had then at leaſt perſwaded him away from the Court, but at that time the Souldiers indured his ſtay, though with ſome regret; But his Lordſhips ſecond appearance at that time and manner as before relared, ſo kightened, (it ſeems their former jealouſies and exaſperated them into ſuch reſolutions, as that divers of them whoſe names I proteſt I know not, not ſo much as one for preſent) being of ſeverall Regia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments came about five of the Clock, next morning, to his Lordſhips Chamber doore, deſired to ſpeake with him, upon notice whereof, I haſtened to the Earl of <hi>Louderdales</hi> Lodgings, and the Earle of <hi>Denby</hi> with me: We found the Souldiers and the Lord <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi> reaſoning very calmly together, his Lordſhip telling them he was a publike perſon, and they could offer him no affront, but it would reflect upon the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and tend to devide the two Nations, the Souldiers told him, they found he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times acted as a private perſon, as when in the painted Chamber hee undertooke for all <hi>Scotland</hi> to engage as one man againſt the Army, (which as they heard) he had no Commiſſion for from the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> what they did was in Reference to the Lord <hi>Louderdale</hi> and not to the Scotiſh Nation: and had his Lordſhip ſhewed any Commiſſion, Paſſe, or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, teſtifying his being ſent or imployed thither as a publique perſon from the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or their Commiſsioners, I conceive it might have ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Denbigh</hi> endeavoured with all the Reaſons and arguments he could to perſwade them to let the Earle of <hi>Louderdale</hi> ſtay, and not meddle with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160535:4"/>him, and my ſelfe commanded ſome of them to their Guard, and the reſt to be gone.</p>
            <p>But from commanding, (the diſcontent being very high) I was inforced, for the preſent to fall to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, I confirmed what the Earle of <hi>Denbigh</hi> before had ſaid to them, that it might bee conſtrued as an injury to the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it would be an offence to the Parliament of <hi>Englaad,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it was a contemning of the Generalls pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when they would not obey Commands, and would expoſe both themſelves, and me to danger, but all in vaine; for indeed that horrid violence, ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to the Parliament, and the forced flight of the Members of both Houſes (whereby that higheſt Authority of the kingdome ſeemed to be at a ſtand) as it put both the City and moſt parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into a monſtrous vein of confuſion, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and licentious workings, and weakned (for preſent) the hands of all men in Authority under the Parliament, ſo it wanted not its influence of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the Army and Souldiery throughout the Kingdome, ſo as Officers could not (at that time) have the like command of their Souldiers, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, nor as now again, ſince the Authority of the Parliament hath been vindicated, and both Houſes (through Gods bleſſing) reſtored to their Honour and Freedome:</p>
            <p>For my owne part (as affaires then ſtood) I am confident the Lord <hi>Denbigh</hi> will witneſſe it for me? I did my utmoſt endeavours to have gotten the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers away, I commanded, I perſwaded, but neither commands nor perſwaſions would prevaile, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160535:4"/>being unanimouſly reſolved his Lordſhip ſhould not ſtay at Court, nor ſpeak again with the King for that time.</p>
            <p>And therefore they would not depart till his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was ready and willing to take Coach.</p>
            <p>When I ſaw I could not exerciſe my commanding power for the preſent in that matter, nor by it, nor by perſwaſion divert them from their Reſolutions: I deſired them at leaſt to be civill towards his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which they performed, not giving his Lordship an ill word, nor laying any hands upon him, Mr. <hi>Cheeſly</hi> his Lordſhips Secretary likewiſe ſeconded me, deſiring the Souldiers to be civill, and to give his Lordſhip leave to ſay his Prayers, the Souldiers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with all their hearts, they would joyne with him; but his Lordſhip told them he had not the gift of prayer, he would not pray publikely, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after went quietly to his Coach, the Souldiers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given a true relation of the demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Carriage of that towards the Lord <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therdale</hi> at <hi>VVoburne,</hi> for the confirmation whereof I referre my ſelf to the Earle of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> who was preſent all the while, and in teſtimony of the truth hereof, I have hereunto ſet my hand.</p>
